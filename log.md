Received initial components to prototype with.

This includes:
+ [Electrosmith Daisy Seed](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) 
+ Aluminium Console
+ [MCP6002-I/P-ND General Purpose OpAmp for input buffering](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MCP6002-I-P/500875?s=N4IgTCBcDaILIGEAKA2ADGsBaAkgeiSwDkAREAXQF8g)
+ [NJM4580D-ND Audio OpAmp for output buffering](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/njr-corporation-njrc/NJM4580D/673772?s=N4IgTCBcDaIHICkCyAWArADgAwBEC0cOIAugL5A)
+ [2 1/4" audio jacks (2223-SJ-63062B-ND)](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cui-devices/SJ-63062B/13155750?s=N4IgTCBcDa5mBmAtAZQFJIGwIAybAEJIByAIiALoC%2BQA)

The initial plan is to build a simple circuit with OpAmps, the jacks and the 5V power supply I have, and have audio simply pass through the Daisy board. The next step will be to program an effect.

Designed initial simple prototype. Simply takes in an audio signal and outputs the same signal. See `prototype_1.asc` for sim.
